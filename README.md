# ELK
Centralized Logging and Monitoring System with ELK, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Zabbix, and Grafana




This project sets up a comprehensive system for centralized logging and monitoring, built using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), PostgreSQL, Nginx, Zabbix, and Grafana, all containerized with Docker on Ubuntu.

Description
This project aims to create a robust and scalable system that enables:

Log Collection and Processing: Using Logstash to collect and process logs from various sources, including our web application.
Log Storage and Search: Elasticsearch for storing logs, providing fast and efficient searching.
Log Visualization: Kibana to visualize and analyze logs, making it easier to identify issues and trends.
Business Data Storage: PostgreSQL for storing business data related to the application.
Load Balancing and Reverse Proxy: Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer for our web application, ensuring high availability and performance.
Infrastructure Monitoring: Zabbix for comprehensive infrastructure monitoring, including servers, networks, and applications.
Monitoring Metrics Visualization: Grafana to visualize monitoring metrics, allowing for the creation of informative dashboards.
